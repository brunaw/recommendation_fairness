# Algorithm Fairness 

---
class: middle

# Algorithm Fairness 

- An algorithm is said to be *fair* if its results are independent
of certain **variables**:
  - Ethnicity, gender, disability, etc 
  
- Defining fairness might be very <b> context dependent </b> 
  - and it can also be very difficult due to its subjectivity 

- Has recently become a popular/strong area of research: 
  - More and more privacy & transparency issues
  - Facebook, Google, etc 
  - Discrimination laws

# Music recommendation fairness 

---
class: middle

# Music recommendation fairness 

- In `r Citep(bibs[key = "pap_unfairness"])`, the authors 
demonstrate that many recommendation algorithms are 
biased towards popular artists 

- In practice, this leads to already popular artists being 
recommended too many times 

- Unfairness:
  - To the users, because they `get recommended artists they probably already know`
  - To the artists, because newer/less popular artists `get less recommended than they deserve`


---
class: middle, inverse

# Tackling the popularity issue

---
class: middle

## Standard prediction method 

- After a recommendation system is fit, we select the 
`Top-N` best recommendations for each user and 
make that the predictions

- Issue:
  - Leads to high popularity unfairness in some cases
  
  
> New approach: change the way the predictions are
made such that the popularity distribution is taken
into account 

---
class: small, middle

## New prediction method 

1. Define a set of users $\mathcal{U}$, 
their music consumption history $\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{U}}$,
the set of artists $A_{\mathcal{I}}$, and
their popularity as $\boldsymbol{Pop}_{A}$
  
2.  Assume the existence
of a hidden variable $z_k, k  \in \{1,\dots,K\}$ 
  in the artist popularity, 
assume it's distribution to be a
Gaussian Mixture and estimate its parameters via the EM algorithm: 

    $$\mathcal{P}=(\boldsymbol{Pop}_{A_{i}} |\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \sum_{k = 1}^{K} \pi_k \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{Pop}_{A_{i}}   | \boldsymbol{\mu}_k, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k),$$

3. Adapt the predictions in a way that it
respects the proportions of each estimated cluster:
  - Predict artists from each cluster based on
  $k$ "quotas" sampled from a  $\text{Multinomial}(\textbf{m}, \boldsymbol{\theta} \approx (\pi_1,\dots, \pi_{K}))$, with m = number of artists to be recommended

```

## Advantages
  
- Is not algorithm dependent
- Does not add any complex steps 
- Easily adapted to different fairness contexts
- Stochastic, leading to less bias in the selected
artists

---
class: middle

## Data 
  
  - A sample of the LFM-1b dataset (listening events from Last.fm), 3000 users separated into three mainstreaminess groups:
    - low (1000 users), medium (1000 users) and
high (1000 users)

- Mainstreaminess: overlap between the listening history of a user and 
the overall listening history of all Last.fm users
  - `How popular are the artists the user listens to` 

- Total: 1.755.361 user-artist interactions and 352.805  artists

- 80%/20% train and test separation (for each group)

- Popularity: the fraction of users that interacted with each artist 
(between 0 and 1)

---
class: middle

## Recommendation Algorithms 
  
  
- `User Item Average`: based on the average listening counts for each user
- `User KNN`: a K-nearest neighbors based method 
- `User KNN-Average`: a K-nearest neighbors based method combined
with the average listening counts for each user
- `Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)`: factorizes the user-artist interaction matrix in order to approximate each user's preferences


> Goal: to make their predictions more 'fair'
in popularity terms
